# GraphHopper Navigation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation)

This repository converts routes that are calculated with GraphHopper in a json that is consumable with the [Mapbox Navigation SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android) and provides the server side part of a navigation application.

On the client side, currently only tested for Android, you can just use the Mapbox Navigation SDK like we do in [this repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example).
